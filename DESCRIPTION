Description: qsurvey is a toolkit for working with the Qualtrics platform and
    its survey data in R.  It focuses on testing and review of surveys before
    fielding, and analysis of responses afterward. Examine branching,
    randomization, and question attributes; represent survey flows as directed
    graphs for plotting or interactive review in Shiny; download and manipulate
    response data. For more see the project site.
